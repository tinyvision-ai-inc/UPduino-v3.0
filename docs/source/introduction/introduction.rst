Introduction
============

The UPduino 3.0 is a highly capable device. We will get started with setting it up, and the "hello world" of this FPGA, getting an LED to blink!


First Steps
-----------

First things first, after ensuring your board is functioning and shows up as a USB device, the tools need to get installed. There are two paths to do:

- APIO or icetools (For MacOS, Linux, and Windows)
- Lattice Radiant (Linux and Windows only)

To install these tools, please go to the "Tool Installation" document!
